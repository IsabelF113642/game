        <h1>My World of Gaming</h1>
        
        <h2>Introduction </h2>
        <p>
           I'm a student at the Engineering and Science Magnet University School or ESUMS (what a mouthful right?!) 
          * Never stop working hard*
        </p>
        
        <h2>What is a game?</h2>
        <p> 
          A game is made to bring entertainment to people and bring them together. 
         </p>

        <h3>Favorite Game </h3> 
        <p>
            My favorite game is Game Pigeon, specifically Darts (and Mini Golf), 
            for I can play with friends that I never really talk to or get to hang out with.
