<p> My team and I created a simple game with a unique board pattern with dice rolling as our mechanics to move.
    What set our game apart from the rest is that we had special rules- when two players are on the same square, 
    if you roll certain numbers/combinations, etc.- to make the game more interesting.</p>

<p> We wanted each player to have a separate journey to the end, so that's exactly what we did. Each icon would represent a different 
    player and where they will have to go-by following their icon in a clockwise direction. </p>

<p> During our test game, we chose for our player pieces to be dinosaurs and we had a fun time
    seeing the ways the pieces interacted with each other. </p>
<h2 id ="video">Video Game Exploration</h2>
<p>I wanted to create the simple game of coin collector, but I wanted to add a little bit of spice to make the game more fun. 
   So, I took the image of the fox and made him grab a coin. </p>
<img src="pygame/images/fox.png" alt="Original Fox" >
<img src="pygame/images/foxcollect.png" alt="Fox Holding Coin">
    <p>Then I thought "why not give him sumglasses?" So I did!</p>
<img src="pygame/images/foxcollectglasses.png" alt="Fox Holding Coin with Glasses">
    
    <p> Here is some of my code that shows how I was able to use the updated fox image after he collected the coin! I set 
    the image to be used for only 1 second before resetting to the original image so that the fox's hands are free to collect more coins.</p>
<pre>
  if coin_collected:
        score = score + 10
        place_coin()
        set_fox_collected()

def set_fox_collected():
    fox.image= "foxcollectglasses"
    clock.schedule_unique(set_fox_normal, 1)
</pre>
